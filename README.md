# oscillators_example_cpp
The code in this repository is a basic example for the real-time generation of signals. 

This example, in particular, shows how to generate data for sinusoidal oscillation using classes and inheritance to progressively specialise pieces of code.

The code also provides two examples based on the generation of data sample-by-sample, as well as on the generation of vectors of data, which is a more standard approach for real-time audio.
